# Bike Sharing predictions

The goal is to build a required model that predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. Based on the model prediction/ demand understand, the stretegy will be manipulated to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. The most fit model will be further way for understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
